# Granchio

Granchio is a platform where you can read, publish and comment completely anonymously.
It is a blog aimed at allowing people to express problems, feelings, frustrations or just to have fun among us bootcampers.
It also has an extra function that has the sole purpose of giving you feedback based on your mood, laughter is never enough!

## The problem
Sometimes the bootcampâ€™s rhythms can be stressful.
Some people are not comfortable sharing their problems publicly and it's never easy ask for mental health support.

## The solution
Create an app where bootcamper are free to the support they need in a complete anonymous way and/or with the help of a rubbery angry ducky!
